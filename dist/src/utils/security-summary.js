/**
 * Derive a `SecuritySummary` from an API skill row's flat security columns.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` when the skill has never been scanned
 * (`last_scanned_at == null`) — never scanned is a distinct state from
 * "scanned but no verdict" and callers must not conflate the two by
 * shipping a placeholder `{ passed: null, ... }` object for skills that
 * were never scanned at all.
 *
 * `security_findings_count` is not a stored column — `findingsCount` is
 * always derived from the length of the `security_findings` jsonb array
 * (defensively 0 when the value is missing or not an array).
 *
 * @param apiSkill - Object carrying the flat security columns from an
 *   `ApiSkill`/`ApiSearchResult` row (registry API response shape).
 * @returns The derived summary, or `undefined` when never scanned.
