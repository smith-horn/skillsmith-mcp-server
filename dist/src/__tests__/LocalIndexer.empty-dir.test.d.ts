/**
 * SMI-4829 gate #2: LocalIndexer empty-directory contract.
 *
 * Sibling file to LocalIndexer.test.ts. Lives separately because the parent
 * file already exceeds the 500-line gate (~840 lines as of cutover); the
 * SMI-4829 plan §"What NOT to do" forbids in-scope refactoring of unrelated
 * tests. Placing the new test here keeps both files green and readable.
 *
 * Contract from investigation §6.2.3 + plan §3: LocalIndexer.index() MUST
 * return [] (not throw) for three states of the .claude/skills/ directory:
 *   (a) present + non-empty  — covered by LocalIndexer.test.ts (existing)
 *   (b) present + empty       — covered HERE (new for shape (b) cutover)
 *   (c) absent                — covered by LocalIndexer.test.ts:328 (existing)
 *
 * State (b) is the dominant external-contributor scenario post-cutover:
 * the `.claude/skills/` mount-point exists as a submodule mount but the
 * contributor never ran `git submodule update --init` (or the per-clone
 * sparse-checkout cone filtered everything out).
