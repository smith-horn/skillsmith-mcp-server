 * @module @skillsmith/mcp-server/audit/security-audit.types
 *
 * The security audit is the PRODUCER that feeds the shipped 2A comparator
 * (`compareScanReports`, SMI-5535). It scans each installed skill's on-disk
 * content with `@skillsmith/core`'s `SecurityScanner`, compares the current
 * `ScanReport` against a per-skill baseline persisted across runs, and emits
 * one finding per skill whose security posture is hostile / suspicious /
 * currently-failing. Mirrors `rot-detector.types.ts`'s shape (a finding type
 * plus an options type) so the report writer + digest can consume it
 * uniformly.

 * The three user-facing security verdicts.
 *
 * - `hostile`   — a previously-passing skill introduced new high/critical
 *   findings (or crossed the risk threshold): a genuine benign→malicious
 *   rug-pull, per `compareScanReports`.
 * - `suspicious`— an update materially worsened the skill's risk without
 *   meeting the hostile bar (new medium findings or a material score rise).
 * - `malicious` — the skill FAILS the scanner right now and we have no prior
 *   baseline to prove a transition (freshly-tracked or side-loaded skill that
 *   never passed through the install-time quarantine gate). Not a rug-pull,
 *   but an actively-flagged skill worth surfacing.
