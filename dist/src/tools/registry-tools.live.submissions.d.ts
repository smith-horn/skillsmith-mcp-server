/**
 * @fileoverview Metadata-only read-back of `pending` private-registry rows via the
 * `get_private_registry_submissions` RPC, plus the `review_private_registry_submission`
 * decision RPC (ADR-129, SMI-5949 D-5)
 * @module @skillsmith/mcp-server/tools/registry-tools.live.submissions
 * @see docs/internal/implementation/smi-5949-approval-gate.md
 *
 * Split out of `registry-tools.live.ts` to keep that file under CLAUDE.md's <500-line guidance
 * (the established `.live.auth.ts`/`.live.audit.ts`/`.live.content.ts` companion-module
 * convention). `readBackSubmission()` (Wave 2 Step 2) backs `publish()`'s D-4(c) read-back;
 * `listSubmissions()`/`reviewSubmission()` (Wave 2 Step 4) back the `submissions`/`approve`/
 * `reject` actions and share this file's row type and RPC name rather than duplicating either.
 *
 * WHY THESE RPCS EXIST AT ALL (D-4(a)/(c)).
 *
 * The D-4 RLS policy hides a `pending`/`rejected` row from every plain SELECT — including from its
 * own submitter — so `publish()` cannot use `INSERT … RETURNING` to confirm what it just wrote
 * (empirically confirmed against staging: an `authenticated` INSERT without `.select()` succeeds
 * and the row lands; the identical insert WITH `.select().single()` instead raises `"new row
 * violates row-level security policy"` and the whole write rolls back), and `approve`/`reject`
 * cannot be a PostgREST `UPDATE … RETURNING` for the same reason (D-4(b)). `get_private_registry_
 * submissions(p_team_id, p_status)` is a `SECURITY DEFINER` function whose `RETURNS TABLE` column
 * list has **no `content` column at all** — pending content is unreachable by construction, not by
 * an omitted predicate (D-4(c)) — and it authorizes a caller to see a non-approved row only when
 * `published_by = auth.uid()` or the caller is a team admin. `review_private_registry_submission`
 * is the paired `SECURITY DEFINER` write: it does the actual admin/self-approval/terminal-state
 * checks (D-5/D-6/D-8) inside the database, in the same transaction as the write.
