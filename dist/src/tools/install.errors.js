/**
 * @fileoverview `install_skill`'s structured error-envelope builders.
 * @module @skillsmith/mcp-server/tools/install.errors
 *
 * Every one of these returns an `InstallResult` with `success: false` rather
 * than throwing. That is the whole point of the file: an MCP caller cannot
 * distinguish a protocol-level `isError` from a transport failure, so an
 * application-level failure has to arrive through the result envelope. The
 * convention comes from `team-workspace.ts` and is mirrored by
 * `uninstall.ts`'s own `buildScopeError`.
 *
 * Moved out of `install.ts` by the post-merge retro on cfc96eccd (SMI-6733),
 * which found that file at 499 of its 500-line pre-commit ceiling — one line
 * of headroom, with the gate blocking rather than warning. A pure move: no
 * signature, body or docblock changed, and `install.ts` is the only importer.
 *
 * @see SMI-4288, SMI-4737, ADR-139
