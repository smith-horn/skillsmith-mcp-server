/**
 * @fileoverview Tests for install.helpers.manifest.ts's real-home write guard.
 *
 * SMI-6343 Wave 1 follow-up (adversarial review): `saveManifest()` and
 * `updateManifestSafely()` here are a second, complete manifest write stack
 * parallel to `@skillsmith/core`'s `ManifestManager` — `MANIFEST_PATH` is
 * homedir-derived (install.types.ts) with no path-override parameter, so
 * before this fix nothing but the global `$HOME` test sandbox
 * (vitest.setup.ts) protected this write path. This proves the new
 * `assertNotRealUserHome()` guard itself fires, by pointing
 * `SKILLSMITH_TEST_REAL_HOME` at whatever home `MANIFEST_PATH` currently
 * resolves under (the sandbox, in this test run) so the guard treats it as
 * "the real home" for these assertions — the same technique
 * home-sandbox.integration.test.ts uses.
 *
 * SMI-6735: `acquireManifestLock()`/`releaseManifestLock()` were removed
 * when locking moved onto the shared `withFileLock` (owned-lock) primitive —
 * `updateManifestSafely()` is now the only entry point, and (like
 * `ManifestManager.updateSafely()`) it calls the guard FIRST, before
 * `withFileLock` ever attempts to create a lock file.

// delegation reverted to the pre-fix `MANIFEST_PATH + '.tmp.' + process.pid` body,
// all 49 tests across this file, tests/unit/install-helpers.test.ts and core's
// skill-manifest.test.ts passed. Measured, not argued — that is the same
// invisible-success class the delegation itself was written to remove.

// green under the revert precisely because the revert does not touch core.

// non-empty directory, so `writeFile(temp)` succeeds and the final

// exists at the moment the write fails, which is the only window in which the
