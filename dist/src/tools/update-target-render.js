/**
 * @fileoverview Shared reason/result text TABLE for the MCP surface — the data a
 *   renderer will use. Not itself a renderer: nothing consumes it yet
 *   (SMI-6532 step 6, §4.4 of
 *   docs/internal/implementation/update-safety-and-source-resolution.md).
 *
 *   §4.4: "Each surface renders its own text: CLI `manage.update.render.ts`,
 *   MCP `outdated.ts` and `skill-updates.ts`, VS Code `manifestReader.ts`."
 *   ONE shared table here rather than one per MCP tool: both `outdated.ts`
 *   and `skill-updates.ts` live in this same package, so two separate
 *   38-member tables would be a drift surface where a new union member has
 *   to fail typecheck twice (once per table) to be caught, instead of once.
 *   §4.4's three-surface parity is over CLI / MCP / VS Code, not over
 *   individual tools within a surface.
 *
 *   NOT WIRED into either tool as of this writing (2026-09-26): neither
 *   `outdated.ts` nor `skill-updates.ts` classifies a target against
 *   `UpdateTargetReason`/`UpdateResultCode` at all today — `outdated.ts`
 *   renders its own, older, unrelated `OutdatedDiagnosis` five-state model
 *   (`current | outdated | local-drift | identity-mismatch | unknown`, see
 *   `outdated.identity.ts`), and `skill-updates.ts` reports a plain
 *   `updateAvailable: boolean` off `compareSkillContentHashes()`'s outcome.
 *   Neither has a call site that produces an `UpdateTargetReason` or
 *   `UpdateResultCode` to render. That call site arrives with SMI-6532 step
 *   5 / A1's update-target classification pipeline (`update-target-gate.ts`,
 *   `update-target.probe.ts`) landing behind an MCP entry point. Exporting
 *   this table now, unwired, makes this package's half of §4.4's member set
 *   checkable today without inventing a call site that would change either
 *   tool's current output shape. That is PREPARATORY, not step 6 complete:
 *   §4.4 says each surface RENDERS and T-R4 fails on a member that renders
 *   empty, so a table nothing consumes meets the data-shape half of the
 *   requirement and none of the behavioural half. Completion is wiring these
 *   tables into surface output, which needs step 5's call sites.
 *
 *   The check lives in the CORE package, not in a sibling `.test.ts` here: it
 *   AST-reads this file, because core cannot import mcp-server. It checks the
 *   TABLE, not rendering — nothing asserts that a user ever sees any of this
 *   text.
 *
 *   Total `Record<UpdateTargetReason | UpdateResultCode, string>` (§4.4:
 *   "Every renderer is a `Record<UpdateTargetReason | UpdateResultCode,
 *   ...>`, so a new member fails typecheck") — deliberately not a function
 *   with a `switch`/default branch, which would keep compiling after either
 *   union grows and silently render nothing for the new member. That is the
 *   exact silent-success shape CLAUDE.md's "assert the property that makes
 *   the code correct, not the value a correct implementation happens to
 *   emit" rule (SMI-6732) warns against, and the same rationale
 *   `update-target-reason.ts` itself gives for using a `Record` everywhere.
 *
 *   `UpdateTargetReason` and `UpdateResultCode` share two literal strings
 *   (`recovery-pending`, `recovery-record-unreadable` — see `UpdateCode`'s
 *   doc comment in `@skillsmith/core`'s `update-target-reason.ts`), so
 *   TypeScript's mapped type collapses the union to 36 distinct keys, not
 *   38: both call sites (as a classification reason, and as an apply result
 *   code) read the same sentence for those two strings, which is correct —
 *   `remediationFor` resolves both to the same remediation kind too (a
 *   `doctor` recovery workflow either way), because it is the same
 *   underlying condition discovered at a different pipeline stage.
 *
 * @module @skillsmith/mcp-server/tools/update-target-render
 */
/**
 * One short, human sentence per closed-set member (§4.4). No trailing
 * period, and never "see the docs" — this text names what happened; the
 * generated next step (once a call site exists) comes from
 * `remediationFor()`'s data, not from this table.
