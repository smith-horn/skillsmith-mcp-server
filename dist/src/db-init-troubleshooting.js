/**
 * @fileoverview What to print after a database-init failure, by failure kind.
 * @see SMI-6991, found in the post-merge retro of SMI-6961.
 *
 * **Why this is its own module.** `index.ts` runs `main().catch(...)` at module
 * scope, so importing it to test a decision would start the server. The
 * decision therefore lives here, where it is a pure function.
 *
 * **The defect.** The init catch printed one fixed troubleshooting block for
 * every failure, ending with *"Set SKILLSMITH_FORCE_WASM=true to use the WASM
 * SQLite fallback"*. That list is about driver **availability** — a native
 * module that will not load. A corruption refusal is a verdict about the
 * **file**, and since SMI-6961 both drivers refuse the same corrupt file, so
 * switching drivers is a dead end. It only ever appeared to help because the
 * WASM driver used to destroy the file, which is the defect SMI-6961 removed.
 *
 * So the last thing a user read after a correct refusal was advice that cannot
 * work, sending them after a configuration problem they do not have — and this
 * is the npx path, where WASM is already the default driver.

 * nothing to add, and the one thing the generic block would add is wrong.
 *
 * Discriminates on `code` via `isCorruptDatabaseError`, never on the message

 * impossible — `troubleshootingFor` is exported for its own tests, and
 * TypeScript does not reject interpolating a nullable string. The test forbids
 * it for THIS function; a new caller needs its own arm (SMI-6991).
