/**
 * @fileoverview Unified shutdown coordinator for the Skillsmith MCP server
 * (SMI-5479, extended SMI-5649 + SMI-5640).
 * @module @skillsmith/mcp-server/shutdown
 *
 * Extracted from `index.ts`'s `main()` into its own module for two reasons:
 * 1. `index.ts` has `main().catch(console.error)` at module scope — importing
 *    it (even for a unit test of an unrelated export) runs the ENTIRE server
 *    bootstrap (DB init, stdio transport connect). This module has no
 *    top-level side effects, so it can be imported and unit-tested directly.
 * 2. Keeps `index.ts` under the `audit:standards` 500-LOC file-size gate.
 *
 * Before this (pass-2 of the plan review), nothing ever called
 * `shutdownPostHog()` — the PostHog client buffers events (10s
 * `flushInterval`, `posthog.ts:95`), so a server that exits before that
 * window elapses loses every buffered `skill_invoke` event: an unsigned bias
 * on the mediation-gate metric (systematically undercounts short sessions)
 * and a smoke run that calls one tool and exits loses the event 100% of the
 * time.
 *
 * SMI-5649 + SMI-5640: this module grew from a single db-close+telemetry-flush
 * trigger into the ONE shutdown coordinator for the whole process. Previously,
 * `context.async.ts` (and its sync sibling `context.ts`) each registered their
 * OWN independent SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers whose fire-and-forget
 * `backgroundSync?.stop()` raced this module's `closeDbOnShutdown()` with no
 * ordering guarantee — an in-flight sync write could hit a closed db. Both
 * independent registrations are now deleted; `index.ts` is the single
 * registration site, and `runShutdownSequence` below owns the ordered
 * sequence: quiesce background work -> close LLM failover -> close/persist db
 * -> flush telemetry. A periodic autosave timer (SMI-5640) also lives here,
 * bounding data loss on an *ungraceful* kill (SIGKILL/crash/power-loss) that
 * no shutdown hook can ever catch.
 *
 * See docs/internal/implementation/mcp-shutdown-followup-hardening-wave-a-design.md
 * for the full design rationale.

 *
 * Never throws — a `getDb()` that itself throws, or a `close()` that

 * state (both `SqlJsDatabaseAdapter` and `BetterSqlite3Database` expose a

 * racing a signal — only calls `.close()` once. No separate module-level
