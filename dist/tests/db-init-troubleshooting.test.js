/**
 * @fileoverview The MCP server's database-init troubleshooting block.
 * @see SMI-6991, found in the post-merge retro of SMI-6961 (PR #3008).
 *
 * The defect: the init catch printed one fixed block for every failure, ending
 * with *"Set SKILLSMITH_FORCE_WASM=true to use the WASM SQLite fallback"*. That
 * is advice about driver **availability**. After SMI-6961 both drivers refuse
 * the same corrupt file, so for a corruption refusal it is a dead end — and it
 * only ever appeared to help because the WASM driver destroyed the file.
 *
 * This is the npx path, where WASM is already the default driver, so the user
 * was being told to switch to the driver they were already using.
