/**
 * @fileoverview Audit trail for private-registry writes (ADR-129)
 * @module @skillsmith/mcp-server/tools/registry-tools.live.audit
 * @see SMI-5882: red-team assessment, What Changes §4a — attribution absent on the MCP path
 * @see SMI-5822: a shared team license key identifies a team, not a person
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT `published_by`.
 *
 * `private_registry_skills.published_by` is server-derived from `auth.uid()` (migration
 * 20260729000000). **`publish` itself now runs on the `user_jwt` path** (SMI-5949 Wave 2 Step 2,
 * D-7) — a real signed-in user's own Supabase JWT, not `SKILLSMITH_LICENSE_KEY` — precisely so
 * `auth.uid()` resolves to a person and `published_by` lands non-NULL. That is a deliberate
 * credential move, not an incidental one: D-6's self-approval check (`review_private_registry_
 * submission()`) can only refuse a submitter approving their own work if it can name the
 * submitter, and a shared team license key never could. `deprecate`/`undeprecate`/`getContent`
 * were already `user_jwt` before that change (SMI-5822/SMI-5905), and SMI-6109 moved the last
 * three holdouts — `list`/`get`/`getNamespace` — over as well. **As of SMI-6109 no MCP-path
 * private-registry operation is license-key-scoped any more**: every `recordRegistryAudit()` call
 * site in this package now passes `authPath: 'user_jwt'`. The `'license_key'` arm of
 * `RegistryAuditAuthPath`/`resolveActor()` is kept deliberately — `audit_logs` still holds
 * historical rows written on that path, and the type is what makes reading them unambiguous — but
 * nothing writes it today.
 *
 * A pre-D-7 service-role publish (an old client, or any path that still presented only a license
 * key) left `published_by` NULL, and this module's job was to record what WAS known — the team,
 * plus a one-way fingerprint of which license key was presented — rather than fabricate a
 * plausible-looking actor. That reasoning is what the `'license_key'` arm still exists to explain
 * for those historical rows; it no longer describes any operation this package writes today.
 * `license_keys.user_id` was never a usable substitute either way: a team's resolvable key is the
 * single row the checkout webhook created for the *purchaser*, then shared with the team, so it
 * names the buyer rather than the caller.
 *
 * Before this module existed, there were zero `audit_logs` writes on any private-registry path,
 * so an Enterprise customer asking "who published this" had no answer at all. Every operation now
 * has an exact one (a real `actorUserId`); historical rows written before their operation moved to
 * the JWT path carry only the bounded answer this module was originally built for: which key,
 * which team, which skill, when.
 *
 * ONE ACTOR PER PATH, NEVER THE WRONG ONE (cross-provider review finding #3).
 *
 * `deprecate`/`undeprecate`/`publish` all run through the signed-in user's own JWT, so the license
 * key does **not** authorize them — `private_registry_skills_admin_update` /
 * `private_registry_skills_member_insert` do, against a real `auth.uid()`. Writing
 * `license_key:<fingerprint>` as the `actor` for those rows would name a credential that had no
 * say in the decision, which is a materially misleading security record. The `actor` is therefore
 * chosen by `authPath`: the JWT's own subject on the `user_jwt` path, the key fingerprint on the
 * `license_key` path. When the JWT path cannot yield a subject the row says `user_jwt:unknown` —
 * explicitly unattributed, never attributed to the wrong principal. The fingerprint is still
 * recorded in `metadata` on both paths, because "which key was present" stays useful for
 * correlation even when it is not the authorizing credential.
 *
 * Fail-soft by construction: an audit write must never turn a successful publish into a failed
 * one. Failures are logged to stderr (the MCP transport's log channel) and swallowed.

/**
 * Registry operations worth an audit row.
 *
 * `content_read` (SMI-5905 Wave 3) hands a team's packaged skill content to a caller, so it gets
 * the same coverage the mutations do. `event_type` and `action` are byte-identical to what the
 * `private-registry-get` Edge Function writes (supabase/functions/private-registry-get/access.ts),
 * so both transports land in one queryable stream and neither can be audited without the other
 * showing up in the same query.
 *
 * `list`/`get`/`namespace` (SMI-6109) were previously NOT audited here — "metadata reads carry no
 * file bytes" was true, but stopped being the whole story once these three moved off the
 * license-key-scoped service-role client onto the signed-in user's own JWT
 * (`getMemberUserClient()`, `registry-tools.live.ts`). That move introduces a real dual-identity-
 * signal gap: the license key resolves one team, the signed-in user's own membership can silently
 * point at a different one (or none), and RLS fails closed on the mismatch indistinguishably from
 * "genuinely not found." Recording `authRole`/`actorUserId` here is what makes that mismatch
 * observable in the audit stream rather than invisible. `submissions` remains unaudited — it is a
 * metadata read like the pre-SMI-6109 `list`/`get` were, with no comparable identity-mismatch
 * concern (D-5's RPC already evaluates `auth.uid()` itself).
 *
 * `approve`/`reject` (SMI-5949 Wave 2 Step 4, D-5) are the two terminal decisions
 * `review_private_registry_submission()` can write.
