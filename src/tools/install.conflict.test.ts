/**
 * @fileoverview Tests for checkForConflicts' manifest keying (SMI-6358).
 * @module @skillsmith/mcp-server/tools/install.conflict.test
 *
 * Why this file exists, when `install.test.ts` already names `checkForConflicts`:
 * that file mocks the whole module (`vi.mock('./install.conflict.js')`), so it
 * asserts what install.ts PASSES and never executes the function. The
 * post-merge retro on PR #2920 measured the consequence — reverting both
 * `manifestKeyFor(skillName, client)` calls to a bare `skillName` left all 24
 * unit tests and all 11 e2e tests green. The mcp-server third of SMI-6358's
 * fix shipped pinned by nothing.
 *
 * The e2e file could not have caught it either: every one of its call sites
 * passes `CANONICAL_CLIENT`, and `manifestKeyFor(name, CANONICAL_CLIENT)` is
 * the identity function. A test that only ever exercises the canonical client
 * cannot distinguish keyed-by-client from keyed-by-name, however many
 * assertions it makes.
