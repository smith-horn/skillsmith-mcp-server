/**
 * @fileoverview Live Supabase-backed PrivateRegistryService (ADR-129)
 * @module @skillsmith/mcp-server/tools/registry-tools.live
 * @see SMI-5816: Private skill registry — real implementation
 * @see ADR-129: Postgres-native (JSONB) storage, real team-auth (migration 071)
 * @see ADR-116: MCP service-role client + explicit tenant filter
 *
 * Backs `private_registry_publish` / `private_registry_manage` with the real
 * `private_registry_skills` table (migration 20260724000000).
 *
 * THREE CREDENTIALS, FOUR PATHS (SMI-5822 fix, SMI-5882 Wave 3; `getContent` added SMI-5905
 * Wave 3; `publish` moved off service-role SMI-5949 Wave 2 Step 2, D-7):
 *
 * - **Team-scoped reads** (`list`, `get`, `getNamespace`) use the Supabase service-role client.
 *   Service-role bypasses RLS, so **tenant isolation is enforced here**, in-query, via an explicit
 *   `team_id = <resolved>` filter on every request (ADR-116). `teamId` always comes from
 *   `resolve_team_from_license` — never from tool input — so a caller can only ever touch their
 *   own team's rows. This is correct for these operations: the team's license key genuinely
 *   authorizes team-scoped reads, which RLS also grants to any member (`_member_read`). `list`/
 *   `get` also carry a second mandatory in-query predicate, `approval_status = 'approved'`
 *   (SMI-5949 D-4 surfaces 3/4) — service-role bypasses the RLS policy that would otherwise
 *   enforce this, so it must be explicit here, under the same already-documented invariant as the
 *   `team_id` filter. Since SMI-5949 Wave 3, both also carry a third predicate, `deprecated =
 *   FALSE` — a gap the approval-gate work surfaced (`deprecated` was documented as hiding a skill
 *   but no read path enforced it); `list` gains an explicit `includeDeprecated` opt-in, `get` does
 *   not. The actual query logic for both lives in `registry-tools.live.reads.ts`.
 *
 * - **Admin-level writes** (`deprecate`, `undeprecate`) do NOT use service-role. They run through
 *   the signed-in user's own Supabase JWT (`skillsmith login`, SMI-4402), so PostgREST evaluates
 *   `private_registry_skills_admin_update` with a real `auth.uid()` and the database — not this
 *   file — decides whether the caller is a team admin.
 *
 *   Why the change: a team's license key is shared, and `resolve_team_from_license` is
 *   `(p_license_key TEXT) RETURNS TEXT` — it resolves a *team*, never a *person*. Running these
 *   two operations as service-role therefore made the shared key an effective admin credential:
 *   SMI-5882's staging run proved the asymmetry directly (a team *member* reaches 0 rows over the
 *   authenticated path, while the identical UPDATE as service-role deprecated 2 rows). Re-checking
 *   the role in application code was rejected as the fix — it would duplicate a policy that
 *   already exists and can silently drift from it. Letting the existing, proven policy do the work
 *   cannot drift.
 *
 *   Cost, stated plainly: deprecate/undeprecate now require `skillsmith login` in addition to
 *   SKILLSMITH_LICENSE_KEY, and surface an actionable error when no user credential is present.
 *
 * - **Content reads** (`getContent`, SMI-5905 Wave 3) are a third path: the signed-in user's own
 *   JWT (so `_member_read` decides visibility against a real `auth.uid()`), but MEMBER-level, not
 *   admin. `getAdminUserClient()` / `getMemberUserClient()` (`registry-tools.live.auth.ts`) are two
 *   explicitly-named getters for exactly this reason — the choice cannot be defaulted or omitted at
 *   a call site. What decides whether a content read is *entitled* is in
 *   `registry-tools.live.content.ts`, and is scoped to the row's own team, not the caller's tier.
 *
 * - **`publish`** (SMI-5949 Wave 2 Step 2, D-7) is the fourth path, and MEMBER-level like
 *   `getContent` — not admin: any team member may submit a version, not only admins.
 *   `published_by` is `DEFAULT auth.uid()` (migration 20260729000000), which stays NULL on the
 *   service-role path this method used before — and an unconditional BEFORE INSERT trigger (Wave
 *   1) now hard-rejects a NULL `published_by`, so a service-role publish fails outright. Beyond
 *   that trigger, a real submitter identity is also the prerequisite for D-6's self-approval
 *   check: `review_private_registry_submission()` can only refuse a submitter approving their own
 *   work if it can name the submitter, and a shared license key never can. Two consequences the
 *   D-4 RLS gate forces on this method specifically (a `pending` row is invisible even to its own
 *   submitter): the INSERT can no longer request a representation (`.select()`/`RETURNING`) — see
 *   the empirically-confirmed D-4(a) note on `publish()` below — and the freshly-published row is
 *   read back through the metadata-only `get_private_registry_submissions` RPC (D-5) instead.
 *
 * Single-phase write: metadata + content land in one INSERT (ADR-129) — no two-phase
 * Supabase+S3 write/rollback. Published (team_id, skill_id, version) triples are
 * immutable; a re-publish raises a unique violation surfaced as a clear error.
