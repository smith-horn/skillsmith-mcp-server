 * and only owners/admins may promote a member to admin.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT MIRROR, and must never be read as evidence about: RLS itself. Every gate below is
 * an application-level `if`, which a future new method can simply forget; the live policies and
 * SECURITY DEFINER bodies cannot be forgotten at a new call site. Cross-team isolation is

   * The two owner-anchored write gates, mirroring `set_team_member_role`'s F-2/H1 fixes into the
   * grant-write path. Byte-for-byte the same rules and the same refusal copy as gates 4 and 5 of
   * `set_team_role_permission()` / `reset_team_role_permission()`
   * (`20260828000000_rbac_grant_writes.sql`) — if either side moves, both move:
   *
   *  1. Only the OWNER may write or clear a grant for EITHER {@link META_PERMISSIONS} entry.
   *     (Adversarial-review fix: this originally covered `team:manage_rbac` only, leaving an
   *     elevated non-owner free to self-grant SSO control and reach owner authority in two hops.)
   *  1b. SMI-6319: NEITHER {@link META_PERMISSIONS} entry may be GRANTED to a role at all — by
   *     anyone, including the owner. Gate 1 above checks the CALLER and never the TARGET, so
   *     before this fix an owner could hand `admin` or `member` the exact authority gate 1
   *     exists to keep owner-anchored, reaching that end state one call earlier by a caller who
   *     was permitted to make it (confirmed live in SMI-6312 UAT: owner grants `member`
   *     `team:manage_rbac`, then `has_team_permission(team,'team:manage_rbac')` returns true for
   *     that member). The owner loses nothing — the `actor.role === 'owner'` short-circuit in
   *     `hasPermission` above already resolves both unconditionally. `deny` is deliberately NOT
   *     blocked: it can only narrow, and both roles already default to deny per
   *     {@link DEFAULT_ROLE_PERMISSIONS}. Ordered AFTER rule 1 so a non-owner's refusal text is
   *     unchanged, and BEFORE rule 2 so an owner is told the real reason rather than rule 2's
   *     unrelated self-widening copy — byte-identical ordering to the SQL's gates 4 / 4b / 5
   *     (`20260901000000_rbac_meta_permission_not_grantable.sql`).
   *  2. Only an `owner`- or `admin`-role caller may create an `allow` STATE for `(role,
   *     permission)` — whether by writing `effect:'allow'` directly, or by CLEARING an explicit
   *     `deny` on a cell whose built-in default is `allow` (today: `admin` x `registry:approve` /
   *     `registry:deprecate`, per {@link DEFAULT_ROLE_PERMISSIONS}). Confirmation-review fix: the
   *     first draft of this gate only checked `effect === 'allow'`, so a `member`-role caller
   *     blocked from `setRolePermission(teamId,'admin','registry:approve','allow')` could reach
   *     the IDENTICAL forbidden state via `setRolePermission(...,'deny')` (to write a row) then
   *     `resetRolePermission(...)` (to clear it back to the allow default) — two calls landing on
   *     the one state gate 5 exists to keep out of a member-role caller's reach. `wouldWiden`
   *     below evaluates the SAME "does this call end in an allow state" question for both
   *     operations, not just `effect==='allow'`. A `member`-role caller — reaching this only via
   *     an explicit `team:manage_rbac` allow grant — may still review the matrix and remove any
   *     grant that does NOT widen (clearing a cell whose default is `deny`, which is every
   *     `member` cell and, post-SMI-6242, every meta cell). Written as "not owner and not admin"
   *     rather than "is member" so a `null` role also fails closed, matching the SQL's NULL-closed
   *     form.
   *
   * The refusal names the permission actually attempted, so an SSO denial does not claim to be
   * about RBAC; the `permission` field stays {@link MANAGE_RBAC_PERMISSION} because that is the
   * permission the OPERATION required, which is also what the live path reports.
